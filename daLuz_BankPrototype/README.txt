Completed 13 December 2016 for Computer Networks course.
Final Grade for Course: A

This program is a foray into computer networking and the concepts of client/server applications, protocols, and locking.
It simulates how a bank client or administrator could access a banking server to complete actions including:
view account details, view balance, view transaction history, withdraw, deposit, transfer funds, create a new account, access
an existing account.
The console is used for a simple, text-based user interface.


How To Use the Application:
1. Run the BankServer program with the port number as a command line argument.
2. Run the BankClient program with the host name and port number as command line arguments.
3. On the BankClient, you will be prompted for log in information. Dummy accounts have been created for this purpose:
Client:   User - JohnSmith, Pass - password
Admin:    User - JackHull,  Pass - password

For a Client:
A menu will prompt you to select an option to perform on the account from a list. Selecting any option will prompt 
you with instructions for how to perform that action.
There is an account with the number 1002 which the user JohnSmith can transfer to.


For an Administrator:
A menu will prompt you to either create a new account or access another account. Selecting either option will 
prompt you with instructions for how to perform that action.
