Completed 18 May 2016 for Game Programming course
Final Grade for Course: A

This program is my attempt to partially recreate the classic arcade game Galaga. Original code is combined with some 
base code derived and modified from Dr. Lee Stemkoski's "Beginning Java Game Development with LibGDX". 

The application can be used by going to the "Runnable Galaga Jar" folder and then selecting and 
executing "daLuz_GalagaClone.jar". Otherwise, the project can be compiled and then running "Launcher.java"
